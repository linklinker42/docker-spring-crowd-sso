1. If you delete all cookies for Jira, it will eventually automatically send you to it's login page. The redirect parameter is an absolute URL instead of relative. Just another inconsistency.

2. If the "keycloak-saml.xml" is missing then the SAML adapter will deny all requests to protected resources, however it will return a 200 HTTP status code with no content. It's still secure, but it's just an odd choice of a status code. Might be a bug. I would prefer it use a 500, 401, or 403.
